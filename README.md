# openstack-slurm
In these Project configuration and installation of OpenStack is done and on top of that Slurm is installed such as controller and compute nodes.

OpenStack is comprehensive and powerful open-source cloud computing platform that allows organizations to build, deploy, and manage private and public clouds. It provides a suite of software tools and services designed to control compute, storage and networking resources within a data center, all through a single, integrated platform. SLURM is an open-source, highly scalable resource management and job scheduling system for clusters of computers. It is primarily used in high-performance computing (HPC) environments, where many computing nodes (servers) work together to process jobs that require large amounts of processing power, memory, or storage. SLURM manages the allocation of these resources, schedules jobs, and ensures that jobs are run in an efficient and fair manner.
