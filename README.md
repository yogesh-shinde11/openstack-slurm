# openstack-slurm
In this project multi node OpenStack is Configured and Installed using DevStack. multi node contain controller and compute node in which VM instances are created on top of compute node. on top of those VM instances multi node slurm is configured and installed.  

OpenStack is comprehensive and powerful open-source cloud computing platform that allows organizations to build, deploy, and manage private and public clouds. It provides a suite of software tools and services designed to control compute, storage and networking resources within a data center, all through a single, integrated platform. 
SLURM is an open-source, highly scalable resource management and job scheduling system for clusters of computers. It is primarily used in high-performance computing (HPC) environments, where many computing nodes (servers) work together to process jobs that require large amounts of processing power, memory, or storage. SLURM manages the allocation of these resources, schedules jobs, and ensures that jobs are run in an efficient and fair manner.
